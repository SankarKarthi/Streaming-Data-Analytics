*Analytics in E-Commerce through Market Research and Customer-Centric Analysis*


Overview



The objective of this project is to collect in-depth and up-to-date data regarding contemporary consumer preferences and trends within the realms of food, clothing, and groceries. This robust dataset will form the bedrock for the creation of a cutting-edge E-commerce delivery application that aspires to be the ultimate solution for fulfilling all fundamental human needs.

Our goal is to thoroughly understand consumer behaviors, demographics, and shopping habits by leveraging Google Forms for data collection, followed by meticulous analysis using Power BI. Through this analysis, we intend to extract valuable insights that will guide the development and strategic direction of the E-commerce app. The utilization of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model will empower us to delve into customer feedback, decipher sentiment, and pinpoint prevalent themes. This project is geared towards creating a data-driven foundation for the development and refinement of our E-commerce delivery app, ensuring that it remains agile and responsive to the ever-evolving needs and expectations of our diverse customer base.
